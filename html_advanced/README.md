# Webpage Implementation Project

## Overview

This project involves implementing a webpage from a designer file using pure HTML semantic structure. The focus of this initial project is to accurately translate the design specifications into a well-structured HTML document without any CSS styling. The designer file is provided via Figma, and this README aims to outline the objectives and provide instructions for accessing the design and fonts needed.

## Objectives

1. **HTML Structure**: Create a well-structured and semantic HTML document based on the provided Figma design file.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the HTML structure supports accessibility standards.
3. **Maintainability**: Write clean and maintainable HTML code that can be easily styled and modified in future projects.

## Designer File

The design for this project is available on Figma. Follow the instructions below to access the design:

1. **Create a Figma Account**: If you do not already have an account, you can create one for free at [Figma](https://www.figma.com).
2. **Access the Design**: Visit the following link to view the design: [Webpage Design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/URL-to-Figma-Design).
3. **Duplicate to Drafts**: Once on the design page, click on "Duplicate to your Drafts" to have full access to all design details and layers.

## Fonts

To ensure that the design is accurately implemented, you may need to install the following fonts:

- **Source Sans Pro**: [Download Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- **Spin Cycle OT**: [Download Spin Cycle OT](https://example.com/link-to-spin-cycle-ot-font)

## HTML Structure Guidelines

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) to create a meaningful document structure.
- **Accessibility**: Include necessary accessibility attributes such as `alt` text for images and `aria` labels where appropriate.
- **Clean Code**: Ensure the HTML code is well-indented and organized for readability and maintainability.

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
2. **HTML File**: Create an `index.html` file in the project directory.
3. **Implement Structure**: Based on the Figma design, implement the HTML structure in the `index.html` file.
4. **Review**: Check your HTML code against the Figma design to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Example Structure

Here is an example outline of the HTML structure based on typical webpage sections:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Webpage Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Navigation and logo -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <!-- Main content -->
        </section>
        <aside>
            <!-- Sidebar content -->
        </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
